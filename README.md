PROJECT ANALYSIS

    • Target user profile: The final user will be anyone interested in my profile,
      specially a computer scientist recruiter who is looking to hire someone. 

    • Information architecture: For this project I have created a single page website, 
      as I think it displays best the information. It is divided into three sections.
      The first one is the about me section, which displays basic information about myself.
      The second one is the experience section which displays my professional experience in the industry.
      Lasty I have added a contact me form, so that anyone who is further interested in me can contact 
      me easily. 

    • Visual design: For this project, I went with white background and grey elements which I think go along
      pretty well. The white gives clarity while the grey provides firmness without beeing as aggressive as black.
      I have also used some background shadow in some elements to add depth to the page.
